The Visualization of NFL Draft Picks From 2009-2019
________________________________________

In this project, entitled, “The Visualization of NFL Draft Picks From 2009-2019”, we look at the draft history of the 32 teams over the last 10 years.  Through this data analysis, we look at different concept, how they are used with our data, and the different technologies to make this information conducive for someone wanting to learn more about the positions, colleges, and conferences that are most likely to have draft picks. 

From a conceptual view, we will use the knowledge gained in this course and create an interactive chart that shows what pick and year a player was drafted.  It includes the player name, college and position as part of this visualization. Additionally, we will use a leaflet to show the positions, players, colleges and conferences so that as you move over each one, you will see how those draft picks are distributed in the 13 Conferences, Independent Schools, 13 positions and 351 players drafted from 2009 to 2019 as 32 picks in the first round of the Annual NFL Draft. 

In terms of technologies used, this project incorporates the following: 
1.	HTML/CSS
2.	Bootstrap
3.	Javascript
4.	Visual Studio Code
5.	DB Browser SQL Lite
6.	Web Scraper
7.	Leaflet
8.	Amazon Web Services

Finally, it is our hope through this project that one will be able to review the visualizations and see how  different conferences and colleges have had an impact on the NFL Draft in the First Round over the past 10 years.  As we enter the COVID-19 era of sports through social distancing and other adjustments, this data can be used in a virtual mode for those studying drafts, both from a historical perspective moving into a Amazon Web Services perspective, both now and in the future.
